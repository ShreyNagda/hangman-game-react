# Hangman Game

Welcome to the **Hangman Game**! A classic word-guessing game where players try to figure out a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. But be careful! With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangmanâ€™s body is drawn. You have only **7 guesses** to get it right before the hangman is complete.
